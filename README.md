## 📘 Project Overview
**Easy-E** is a desktop-based event management system built using **C# Windows Forms** and **MySQL**.  
It was developed to streamline the organization, scheduling, and attendance tracking of multi-day academic events at **Mapúa Malayan Colleges Mindanao (MMCM)**.

Traditional methods of managing attendance and event data rely on manual sign-in sheets and spreadsheets, which are error-prone and time-consuming. Easy-E automates these processes to provide a secure, efficient, and user-friendly system for administrators and event organizers.
